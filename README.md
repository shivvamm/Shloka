## About

Shloka is a side project I started in 2023 because I could not find an API that provides Sanskrit Shlokas on Bgagavad Gita and other Holy Scriptures. So I ended up creating this API so that you don't have to.

> API is written in Express and hosted on ~~render~~. The frontend is in NextJS hosted on Vercel.

> _Update (June 24, 2023)_: Migrated server side hosting to Render from Heroku as [Heroku has eliminated all of their free dynos.](https://blog.heroku.com/new-low-cost-plans)
